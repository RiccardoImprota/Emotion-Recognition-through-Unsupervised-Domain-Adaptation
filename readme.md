The project consists in comparing at least two different methods for unsupervised domain adaptation and showing the results in a table. The results shall show performance on the source dataset, and performance on the target dataset. Moreover, the upper bound will be evaluated by training and testing the models on the target dataset as a sort of oracle predictor.

Google Colab was used for the project for computational reasons.
